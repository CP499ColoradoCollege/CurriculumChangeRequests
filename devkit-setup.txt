Our devkits are running Ubuntu 16.04
To set up, issue the following packages in order:

sudo apt install update
sudo apt install apache2

Now, verify the apache2 installation.

Find you IP address with the following command:

hostname -I

Now, go to Firefox and paste your IP into the address bar.
If it works, you will be routed to a page titled "Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page"

Next, we will install Mysql

sudo apt install mysql-server php-mysql

to test installation:

mysql -uroot -p

sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mcrypt

to verify php installation:

Navigate to /var/www/html
cd ../../var/www/html/

Create info.php file:
touch info.php

add the following php code to info.php:
<?php
phpinfo();
?>

Save, then boot up browser
In the address bar, type <your IP>/info.php
The resulting web page should display information about your installation of php.

Next, we must install two php extensions:

sudo apt install php-zip php-xml

Next, install composer to manage php libraries

sudo install composer

With composer we can install PHPword, and its dependancies.

sudo composer require zendframework/zend-stdlib
sudo composer require zendframework/zend-escaper
sudo composer require phpoffice/phpword

Next, we will install Java

Update package repository:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjkd-8-jdk

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/<your java installation>
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

Verify your installation:
java -version
